# CloudSearch

This is a simple Ruby wrapper around the Amazon's CloudSearch API. It has support for searching (with both simple and boolean queries), pagination
and documents indexing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "cloud_search"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cloud_search

## Usage

The example bellow uses the Amazon's example database called `imdb-movies`:

### Use your AWS CloudSearch configuration
``` ruby
CloudSearch.configure do |config|
  config.domain_id   = "pl6u4t3elu7dhsbwaqbsy3y6be"
  config.domain_name = "imdb-movies"
end
```

### Search for 'star wars' on 'imdb-movies'
``` ruby
searcher = CloudSearch::Searcher.new
resp     = searcher.with_fields(:actor, :director, :title, :year, :text_relevance)
         .with_query("star wars")
         .search
```

### Or you can search using part of the name
``` ruby
searcher = CloudSearch::Searcher.new
resp     = searcher.with_fields(:actor, :director, :title, :year, :text_relevance)
         .with_query("matri*")
         .search
```

### You can also search using boolean queries
``` ruby
searcher = CloudSearch::Searcher.new
resp     = searcher.with_fields(:actor, :director, :title, :year, :text_relevance)
         .as_boolean_query
         .with_query("year:2000")
         .search
```

### You can sort the result using a rank expression (previously created on your CloudSearch domain)
[Rank expressions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/tuneranking.html) allow you to customize how results are ranked. You can use them to weight specific fields, or limit results only to those that meet a certain numeric threshold.

``` ruby
searcher = CloudSearch::Searcher.new
resp     = searcher.with_fields(:actor, :director, :title, :year, :text_relevance)
           .with_query("matrix")
           .ranked_by("my_rank_expression")
```

If you want to rank using descending order, just prepend the expression name with a '-' sign:

``` ruby
resp = searcher.with_fields(:actor, :director, :title, :year, :text_relevance)
       .with_query("matrix")
       .ranked_by("-my_rank_expression")
```

## Results
``` ruby
resp.results.each do |result|
  movie = result["data"]

  # List of actors on the movie
  movie["actor"]

  # Movie's name
  movie["title"]

  # A rank number used to sort the results
  # The `text_relevance` key is added by AMS CloudSearch
  movie["text_relevance"]
end
```

## Pagination

The results you get back are (currently) API-compatible with will\_paginate and kaminari:

``` ruby
searcher = CloudSearch::Searcher.new
resp     = searcher.with_fields(:actor, :director, :title, :year, :text_relevance)
         .with_query("star wars")
         .with_items_per_page(30)
         .at_page(10)
         .search

resp.total_entries #=> 5000
resp.total_pages   #=> 167
resp.current_page  #=> 10
resp.offset        #=> 300
resp.page_size     #=> 30
```

[Kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) users can use the same `at_page()` and `with_items_per_page()` methods with the searcher. In the view, `paginate` will work as expected with the response: `<%= paginate @response %>`

## Indexing documents

``` ruby
document = CloudSearch::Document.new :type    => "add", # or "delete"
                                     :version => 123,
                                     :id      => 680,
                                     :lang    => :en,
                                     :fields  => {:title => "Lord of the Rings"}

indexer = CloudSearch::Indexer.new
indexer << document # add as many documents as you want (CloudSearch currently sets a limit of 5MB per documents batch)
indexer.index
```
